	<p>As brand designer for SteamWox Products Ltd., a new local manufacturer specializing in environmentally-friendly cleaning machines, I created all branding collateral, including logos, brochures, and the company webesite. I built a full customized WordPress theme to allow the client to have appropriate control of the content.</p>

	<h2>Process</h2>

	<article>
		<h3>Ideation</h3>
		<p>The company brand strives to be clean, environmental, as well as sophisticated and high-quality. Based on this concept, I created the company logo, website, and other materials.</p> 
	</article>

	<article>
		<h3>Design</h3>
		<p>Since the company is relatively new, the logo is straightforward to emphasize the company name. I used shades of blue and green to emphasize the eco-friendly appeal of the brand, while the rounded logo font and soft steam-like shapes allude to the steam used in SteamWox cleaning machines.</p>

	<h3>Development</h3>

		<p>I registered a Custom Post Type called Products to add the company products. </p>

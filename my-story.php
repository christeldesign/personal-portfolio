	<p>Hello! My name is Christel and I am a front-end web developer. After graduating with a Bachelor in Fine Arts (Illustration concentration), I was yearning for a new challenge where I could incorporate my art & design background with something technical and digital. Graduating from the Technical Web Developer program at BCIT dispelled any former fear of coding, and I am now very passionate in developing highly functional, and customized websites, while still maintaining creative flair.</p>
